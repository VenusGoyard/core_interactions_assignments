        <h2>IT WAS NOT DEATH, FOR I STOOD UP</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">BY EMILY DICKINSON</h3>
        <p>
          It was not Death, for I stood up,<br>
          And all the Dead, lie down—<br>
          It was not Night, for all the Bells<br>
          Put out their Tongues, for Noon.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not Frost, for on my Flesh<br>
          I felt Siroccos—crawl—<br>
          Nor Fire—for just my Marble feet<br>
          Could keep a Chancel, cool—<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, it tasted, like them all,<br>
          The Figures I have seen<br>
          Set orderly, for Burial,<br>
          Reminded me, of mine—<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          As if my life were shaven,<br>
          And fitted to a frame,<br>
          And could not breathe without a key,<br>
          And ’twas like Midnight, some –<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          When everything that ticked—has stopped—<br>
          And Space stares—all around—<br>
          Or Grisly frosts—first Autumn morns,<br>
          Repeal the Beating Ground—<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          But, most, like Chaos—Stopless—cool—<br>
          Without a Chance, or Spar—<br>
          Or even a Report of Land—<br>
          To justify—Despair.<br>

        <h2>TULIPS</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">BY SYLVIA PLATH</h3>
        <p>
          The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
          Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.<br>
          I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
          As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br>
          I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
          I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
          And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br>
          They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
          Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
          Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br>
          The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
          They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
          Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
          So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br>
          My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
          Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
          They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br>
          Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——<br>
          My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
          My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
          Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br>
          I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
          stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
          They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br>
          Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
          I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
          Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
          I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br>
          I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
          To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
          How free it is, you have no idea how free——<br>
          The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
          And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
          It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br>
          Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br>
          The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
          Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
          Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br>
          Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
          They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
          Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,<br>
          A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br>
          Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
          The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
          Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
          And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
          Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
          And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br>
          The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br>
          Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
          Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
          Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
          Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
          Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
          They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
          Playing and resting without committing itself.<br>
          The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
          The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
          They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
          And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
          Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
          The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,<br>
          And comes from a country far away as health.<br>

        <h2>Lady Lazarus</h2>
        <h3 class="attribution">by Sylvia Plath</h3>
        <p>
          The rain drums down like red ants,<br>
          each bouncing off my window.<br>
          The ants are in great pain<br>
          and they cry out as they hit<br>
          as if their little legs were only<br>
          stitched on and their heads pasted.<br>
          And oh they bring to mind the grave,<br>
          so humble, so willing to be beat upon<br>
          with its awful lettering and<br>
          the body lying underneath<br>
          without an umbrella.<br>
          Depression is boring, I think<br>
          and I would do better to make<br>
          some soup and light up the cave.<br>
