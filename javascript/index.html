    <p>Yesterday when I left the party, 
        I decided to hit up the deli to grab a bottle of water before 
        I have to go home. I walked in the deli and said hi to the deliman.
        <br>
        I walked straight back to the fridge, and underneath the middle shelf crawled out a <span id="word01"></span>.
        I was frozen in shock and confusion. After five hesitating seconds, my voice squeezed out with a question: "What are you doing here?"
        The <span id="word01"></span> looked me in the eyes with solemn concern, and said, "Hi."
        <br>
        I tilted my left foot outward, ready to flee: "What do you want from me?"
        Slowly approaching step by step, was the <span id="word01"></span>, who said: "I've been trying to reach you." 
        "But for what?" If the <span id="word01"></span> comes any closer, I'm going to run, I thought.
        <br>
        It was almost like the <span id="word01"></span> could read my thoughts.
        <br>
        "I've been trying to reach you for your car's extended warranty." Said the <span id="word01"></span>, seconds before chasing after me.
